       The timer is the exact moment you were married, it will serve as a sign of your lasting commitment and love for one another.
        I am so thankful to have you two as great friends of Karis and I, and am excited for what the future holds for ya'll. The Lord's hand is clearly in your life and he will bless you in all you do. Always remember the best is yet to come! <br><br>Sincerly, <br> Will Browning
